**this is a jailbroken version of meteor client that is optimized and obsf'd with UPX

u will need to create an account with a registered g-mail account once you have opened and read the agreements

to open the login prompt you need to run the "exe"

(it should make you read the terms and conditions but if it doesnt you can open them on "legal.txt")
